# PSCKangaroo

GPU-accelerated **Pollard's Kangaroo** for solving the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) on **secp256k1**.

A fork of [RCKangaroo](https://github.com/RetiredC/RCKangaroo) by [RetiredCoder](https://github.com/RetiredC). Special thanks to RetiredCoder for the SOTA method and GPU kernel architecture — the core algorithm and GPU kernel are his work.

## Purpose

PSCKangaroo is built for one scenario: **long-running ECDLP puzzles on a single GPU with lots of RAM.**

The [Bitcoin Puzzle Transaction](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306983.0) challenges define this scenario — known public keys, defined search ranges, and puzzles that may take years on a single machine. When a run may last months or years, what matters is:

1. **No wasted work.** Crashes, reboots, power outages, kernel updates — they all happen. Without checkpoint/resume, months of computation are lost. PSCKangaroo auto-saves and resumes from where it stopped.

2. **No memory crashes.** RCKangaroo has no RAM limit — it allocates memory until the OS kills it (see [OOM analysis](#oom-analysis) below). PSCKangaroo's `-ramlimit` guarantees stable operation indefinitely.

3. **More entries per GB.** PSCKangaroo uses 16-byte entries vs ~40 bytes in RCKangaroo (32 data + 4 pointer + 4 overhead, per RC's own [RAM formula](https://github.com/RetiredC/RCKangaroo/blob/main/RCKangaroo.cpp#L328)). That's **2.5× more DPs in the same RAM**.

For short puzzles (≤ 80 bits), RCKangaroo is faster — see benchmark below. PSCKangaroo targets the puzzles where RCKangaroo can't run safely for extended periods.

## The Mathematical Reality of Large Puzzles

Before choosing any solver, it's important to understand the scale of what we're attempting.

**Puzzle 135** has a 134-bit search range. The expected number of operations to solve it is ~1.15 × √(2¹³⁴) ≈ **2⁶⁷·² operations** — roughly **1.7 × 10²⁰**.

At 3.3 GKeys/s (RTX 5070, v60), that's:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Operations needed | ~1.7 × 10²⁰ |
| Time at 3.3 GK/s | **~1,630 years** |
| Time with 10 GPUs | ~163 years |
| Time with 100 GPUs | ~16.3 years |
| Time with 1,000 GPUs | ~1.6 years |

**No single-GPU solver — RCKangaroo, PSCKangaroo, or any other — can reliably solve Puzzle 135 in a human lifetime.** Everyone running these solvers on Puzzle 135 is playing a probabilistic lottery: hoping to find the collision early, long before the expected time. Some will get lucky; most won't.

PSCKangaroo doesn't change this reality. It is one more tool in the toolbox — optimized for crash resilience and memory efficiency on long runs. The mathematical difficulty of large puzzles requires either massive parallelism (hundreds of GPUs), a breakthrough in algorithms, or extraordinary luck.

That said, someone running a single GPU 24/7 with checkpoint protection has a nonzero chance every second. PSCKangaroo ensures that chance is never wasted by a crash.

## Benchmark: PSCKangaroo v59 vs RCKangaroo v3.1

**Hardware:** NVIDIA RTX 5070 (Blackwell, 12 GB VRAM) / AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D / 123 GB RAM / CUDA 12.9 / Linux

> **Note:** The benchmark below is from **v59** (`PNT_GROUP_CNT=24`). With v60's default of `PNT_GROUP_CNT=48`, PSCKangaroo kernel throughput is ~20% higher (2.7 → 3.3 GKeys/s on RTX 5070), so PSC solve times are expected to drop proportionally for puzzles where the kernel dominates total runtime. A re-run of the Puzzle 80 benchmark with v60 is planned and will replace this table when ready.

**Puzzle 80** (79-bit range, known private key `ea1a5c66dcc11b5ad180`), 5 runs each, **v59**:

| Configuration | Median | Mean | Min | Max | Solved |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **RCKangaroo** DP=16 | **301s** | 299s | 120s | 514s | 5/5 |
| **PSC v59** concurrent DP=12 RAM=8GB | **320s** | 463s | 236s | 837s | 5/5 |
| **PSC v59** concurrent DP=14 RAM=20GB | 423s | 536s | 142s | 1223s | 5/5 |
| **PSC v59** concurrent DP=12 RAM=20GB | 491s | 558s | 252s | 817s | 5/5 |

**Observations:**

- RCKangaroo won by ~6% on median in **v59** (301s vs 320s). With v60's `PNT_GROUP_CNT=48` tuning on Blackwell, PSCKangaroo is expected to match or exceed RC's times on RTX 5070 — RC could in principle adopt the same tuning by recompiling, but is not under active maintenance.
- PSC's best single run (142s) was faster than RC's best (120s) — high variance is normal for a probabilistic algorithm.
- Both solvers run the same GPU kernel — at ~3.1 GKeys/s in v59, ~3.3 GKeys/s in v60 (RTX 5070).
- **For Puzzle 80 and similar short puzzles, both solvers solve in minutes with zero setup overhead.** PSCKangaroo's advantage is in long runs (months/years), not sprints.

## How RCKangaroo and PSCKangaroo Compare

| Aspect | RCKangaroo v3.1 | PSCKangaroo v60 |
|---|---|---|
| GPU kernel speed | ~3.1 GKeys/s | **~3.3 GKeys/s** (same kernel source, `PNT_GROUP_CNT=48` default) |
| Effective bytes per DP | **~40 B** | **16 B** (2.5× more entries/GB) |
| RAM management | No limit (grows until OOM) | `-ramlimit` (stable indefinitely) |
| Checkpoint | **`-tames` (pre-generated TAMEs only)** | **Full** (auto-save + Ctrl+C safe) |
| Crash recovery | Loses all WILDs and solve progress | Resumes from last checkpoint |
| Collision dynamics | Concurrent T+W (t² growth, K≈1.15) | Concurrent T+W (t² growth) |
| Minimum DP @120GB | DP≥24 to run for months | **DP=12+** safely |
| Pre-generate TAMEs | Yes (`-tames file -max N`) | Yes (checkpoint system) |
| Ops limit | `-max` (stops solver, no save) | Runs indefinitely |
| Puzzle 80 median (v59 data) | **301s** | 320s (v60 estimated ~252s) |
| Puzzle 135+ viability | Needs DP≥24, no crash recovery | DP=16, checkpoint every 4h |

**Note on RCKangaroo's `-tames` feature:** RC can pre-generate a TAME table with `-tames file -max N` and reload it across multiple runs. This gives a head start but is not a full checkpoint — WILDs and solve progress are not saved. If the solver crashes during a solve, only the pre-generated tame file survives.

**Note on RCKangaroo's `-max` feature:** RC can limit the number of operations with `-max N`. When reached, the solver stops — but does not save progress (except in tame generation mode). It's a "give up after N ops" limit, not a RAM management tool.

## OOM Analysis

RCKangaroo stores every DP unconditionally. At ~40 bytes per entry with no RAM limit, memory grows linearly until the OS kills the process:

| DP | DPs/s @3.3GK/s | Growth rate | OOM on 120 GB system |
|---|---|---|---|
| 14 | 201,416 | 8.1 MB/s | **~4.1 hours** |
| 16 | 50,354 | 2.0 MB/s | **~16.5 hours** |
| 20 | 3,147 | 126 KB/s | **~11.0 days** |
| 24 | 197 | 7.9 KB/s | **~5.9 months** |

These times are computed from RC's own RAM formula: `(32 + 4 + 4) × total_ops / 2^DP`, verified in `RCKangaroo.cpp` line 328. The `malloc` inside RC's MemPool does not check for allocation failure — OOM results in a segfault with no save.

PSCKangaroo with `-ramlimit 120` runs indefinitely at any DP value. When the table reaches 93% capacity, it freezes (no new TAMEs stored) and continues hunting with 100% WILDs.

## Quick Start

### Recommended: Concurrent mode (v59+)

```bash
./psckangaroo -gpu 0 -dp 16 -range 134 \
  -pubkey 02145d2611c823a396ef6712ce0f712f09b9b4f3135e3e0aa3230fb9b6d08d1e16 \
  -start 4000000000000000000000000000000000 \
  -ramlimit 120 -concurrent 1 -wwbuffer 5 -checkpoint 4
```

This runs TAME and WILD kangaroos simultaneously from second 1 (like RCKangaroo), but with memory protection, checkpoint, and 16-byte compact entries.

> **DP value note:** Lower DP values (12–14) generate more collision candidates per second but increase CPU load and temperature during the HUNT phase. For 24/7 operation, DP=16 is recommended as a balance between collision rate and thermal stability. For short validation runs, DP=12 is fine.

### Resume from checkpoint

```bash
./psckangaroo -gpu 0 -dp 16 -range 134 \
  -pubkey 02145d2611c823a396ef6712ce0f712f09b9b4f3135e3e0aa3230fb9b6d08d1e16 \
  -start 4000000000000000000000000000000000 \
  -ramlimit 120 -concurrent 1 -wwbuffer 5 -checkpoint 4 \
  -loadwild wild_checkpoint.dat
```

### Multiple GPUs (experimental)

Multi-GPU support is inherited from RCKangaroo but has not been tested with PSCKangaroo's concurrent mode. If you have multiple GPUs and want to try:

```bash
# Two GPUs (GPU 0 and GPU 1)
./psckangaroo -gpu 01 -dp 16 -range 134 \
  -pubkey 02145d2611c823a396ef6712ce0f712f09b9b4f3135e3e0aa3230fb9b6d08d1e16 \
  -start 4000000000000000000000000000000000 \
  -ramlimit 120 -concurrent 1 -wwbuffer 5 -checkpoint 4
```

Please report results via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/pscamillo/PSCKangaroo/issues).

### Validation (Puzzle 70, ~30 seconds)

```bash
./psckangaroo -gpu 0 -dp 12 -range 69 -ramlimit 4 -checkpoint 0 -concurrent 1 \
  -pubkey 0290e6900a58d33393bc1097b5aed31f2e4e7cbd3e5466af958665bc0121248483 \
  -start 200000000000000000
```

Expected result: private key `349b84b6431a6c4ef1`.

### Validation (Puzzle 80, ~5–10 minutes)

```bash
./psckangaroo -gpu 0 -dp 12 -range 79 -ramlimit 8 -checkpoint 0 -concurrent 1 -wwbuffer 5 \
  -pubkey 037e1238f7b1ce757df94faa9a2eb261bf0aeb9f84dbf81212104e78931c2a19dc \
  -start 80000000000000000000
```

Expected result: private key `ea1a5c66dcc11b5ad180`.

## Operating Modes

### Concurrent (v59) — recommended

```
-concurrent 1
```

Runs 33% TAME + 33% WILD1 + 33% WILD2 kangaroos from the first second. The TAME table grows while WILDs hunt against it — collision probability grows quadratically (t²) until the table fills, then automatically switches to 100% WILDs.

This is functionally equivalent to how RCKangaroo operates, but with `-ramlimit`, checkpoint, and 2.5× more entries per GB.

### ALL-TAME (legacy)

```
-allwild 0
```

Phase 1 (TRAP): fills all RAM with TAMEs — no collisions possible during this phase. Phase 2 (HUNT): 100% WILDs check against the frozen table. For Puzzle 80, this took 1h31m (1h26m TRAP + 5 min HUNT), while concurrent mode solved the same puzzle in ~5 minutes. Concurrent mode eliminates this dead time.

### ALL-WILD

```
-allwild 1
```

WILD-WILD collisions only, no TAMEs. Experimental — concurrent mode outperforms in all tested scenarios.

### W-W Buffer (v58)

```
-wwbuffer 5
```

Reserves 5% of RAM for a WILD1-WILD2 cross-collision buffer. Adds a second collision channel on top of TAME-WILD detection. In testing, the W-W buffer produced hundreds of additional collision candidates per run. Can be combined with concurrent or ALL-TAME mode.

## How It Works

### The SOTA Kangaroo Method

Pollard's Kangaroo solves ECDLP by launching pseudo-random walks on the elliptic curve:

- **TAME kangaroos** start from known positions (k·G where k is known)
- **WILD kangaroos** start from positions derived from the target public key

When a TAME and WILD land on the same distinguished point (collision), the private key is computed from the difference in their accumulated walk distances.

**Distinguished Points (DPs)** are positions where the x-coordinate has a specific number of leading zero bits. Only DPs are stored, reducing memory by a factor of 2^DP while preserving collision detection.

The **SOTA method** (by RetiredCoder) uses equivalence classes and the negation map to reduce expected operations from ~2.08√n to ~1.15√n. PSCKangaroo inherits this method and GPU kernel unchanged.

### What PSCKangaroo adds

**Concurrent mode (v59):** Eliminates the sequential TRAP/HUNT separation. TAMEs and WILDs run simultaneously from second 1, giving quadratic (t²) collision probability growth while respecting a RAM limit and saving checkpoints.

**16-byte compact entries:** Each DP is stored in 16 bytes using a 20-bit x-signature + 104-bit truncated distance. When a collision is detected, the exact distance is recovered via an async BSGS search (±2³², typically 200–400ms). This fits 2.5× more entries per GB compared to RCKangaroo's ~40-byte entries.

**W-W buffer (v58):** A small hash table (5% of RAM) stores recent WILDs and cross-checks WILD1 vs WILD2 collisions, adding a second collision channel alongside TAME-WILD detection.

**Checkpoint/Resume:** Auto-saves the TAME table at configurable intervals and on Ctrl+C. A crash after weeks of computation costs at most a few hours of work, not the entire run.

## Per-GPU Tuning

The default **`PNT_GROUP_CNT=48`** was empirically validated on RTX 5070 (Blackwell SM 12.0). The optimal value is **architecture-dependent**, primarily a function of the GPU's SM count:

- **Fewer SMs (≤48 CUs):** higher `PNT_GROUP_CNT` (32–48) wins because batch inversion amortization (one ModInv per N MulModPs) matters more when there's less raw parallelism to hide arithmetic cost.
- **More SMs (≥70 CUs):** lower `PNT_GROUP_CNT` (24) wins because the SMs are already saturated and higher PNT only inflates register pressure and L2 traffic without adding throughput.

### Confirmed optimal configurations

| GPU | CUs | Best OCC | Best PNT | GKeys/s | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RTX 5060 Ti | 36 | 2 | 32 | 2.42 (stock) | [#4](https://github.com/pscamillo/PSCKangaroo/issues/4) |
| RTX 5070 | 48 | 1 | 48 | 3.33 (stock) | maintainer (v60 default) |
| RTX 5070 Ti (Aorus Master) | 70 | 1 | 24 | 4.69 (stock) | [#4](https://github.com/pscamillo/PSCKangaroo/issues/4) |
| RTX 5070 Ti (Gigabyte OC) | 70 | 1 | 24 | 4.45 (stock) | [#4](https://github.com/pscamillo/PSCKangaroo/issues/4) |

Notes:
- `PNT=12` triggers severe DP buffer overflow on GPUs faster than ~3 GKeys/s and should be avoided.
- `OCC=2` helps on smaller GPUs (≤36 CUs); on larger ones it's within noise of `OCC=1`.
- Undervolting costs ~3–4% throughput at the optimal config — reasonable trade for thermal headroom on long runs.

### Finding your own optimum

To benchmark your GPU, use the included sweep script:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/bench_psck.sh
./scripts/bench_psck.sh
```

By default it tests `PNT_GROUP_CNT ∈ {12, 16, 24, 32, 48}` × `OCCUPANCY ∈ {1, 2}` (~20 minutes total) and reports the best configuration for your hardware. Results are saved to `~/bench_results/<timestamp>/`. Override with environment variables:

```bash
OCC_LIST="1" PNT_LIST="32 48 56 64" ./scripts/bench_psck.sh
```

On Windows, use `scripts/bench_psck.ps1` (PowerShell) — same logic, same environment-variable overrides.

If a configuration other than those listed above wins on your hardware by a meaningful margin, please open a [PR or Issue](https://github.com/pscamillo/PSCKangaroo/issues) with the results — would help expand the per-architecture tuning table.

## Design History

### What was tried and removed

Earlier versions included GPU-side endomorphism (canonical form), a "cheap second point" (P−J), and extended distinguished points (XDP). These were removed after feedback from kTimesG on BitcoinTalk, who correctly identified that:

- Canonical X form doesn't produce useful collisions below 254-bit ranges
- Cheap second point generates DPs that no kangaroo converges toward
- XDP is functionally equivalent to lowering the DP parameter

### The ALL-TAME lesson

The original PSCKangaroo architecture used sequential TRAP/HUNT phases — fill all RAM with TAMEs first, then hunt with WILDs. While more TAMEs increase collision probability per-check, the TRAP phase is dead time with zero collision probability. For Puzzle 80, ALL-TAME took 1h31m (1h26m TRAP + 5 min HUNT). Concurrent mode solved the same puzzle in ~5 minutes by hunting from second 1. This analysis led to the v59 concurrent mode.

### The PNT_GROUP_CNT lesson (v60)

The default `PNT_GROUP_CNT` had been **24** since v52, when an experimental jump to 200 caused 12 KB of register spill per thread (catastrophic L1 cache thrashing). The rollback to 24 was conservative — the value was chosen for being known safe, not from empirical sweep across valid alternatives.

In v60, an empirical sweep on RTX 5070 (Blackwell SM 12.0) tested `PNT_GROUP_CNT ∈ {12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 56, 64}` × `OCCUPANCY ∈ {1, 2}`. **PNT=48 + OCC=1 won by +27% over the previous default** (2.62 → 3.33 GKeys/s sustained), with zero register spill. The amortization of batch inversion (one ModInv per N MulModPs) turned out to be the dominant factor — not occupancy. PNT=64 was marginally worse; PNT=56 was clearly worse (it doesn't align with the 16-thread tile structure of the kernel).

This gain came purely from re-tuning a constant — no algorithmic change. Other GPU architectures may have different optima; the included `scripts/bench_psck.sh` automates the sweep.

## Changelog

### v60.1 (current — Windows MSVC checkpoint fix)
- **Fixed: `fseek()` 64-bit overflow on Windows MSVC** for checkpoint files larger than ~2.15 GB. The two `fseek()` calls in `LoadWildsHybrid()` and `LoadCheckpoint()` were silently narrowing a `u64` byte offset to 32-bit `long` (LLP64 model), causing silent corruption on cross-mode checkpoint resume. Linux GCC was unaffected (LP64, `long` is 64-bit).
- New `FSEEK64` macro routes to `_fseeki64` on Windows, `fseeko` on POSIX.
- C26495-flagged member variables now initialized at declaration (silences MSVC static analyzer).
- Reported, analyzed, and fix proposed by [@MrX0r](https://github.com/MrX0r) in [#6](https://github.com/pscamillo/PSCKangaroo/issues/6).

### v60 (PNT_GROUP_CNT tuning)
- **Default `PNT_GROUP_CNT` raised from 24 to 48** after empirical sweep on RTX 5070 (Blackwell SM 12.0)
- Speed: 2.62 → 3.33 GKeys/s sustained (+27%) with zero register spill
- Gain comes from better batch inversion amortization, not microarchitectural tweaks
- New `scripts/bench_psck.sh` automates per-GPU sweep — other architectures (Ada, Ampere, Turing) may have different optima

### v59 (concurrent mode)
- **Concurrent mode:** 33% TAME + 67% WILD from second 1, quadratic (t²) collision growth
- New CLI flag: `-concurrent 1`
- Auto-transitions to 100% WILDs when table reaches 93% capacity
- Stats display shows TAMEs growing + WILDs hunting simultaneously

### v58 (W-W buffer)
- Small hash table (5–10% of RAM) for WILD1-WILD2 cross-collision detection
- New CLI flag: `-wwbuffer N`

### v57 (kTimesG cleanup)
- Removed GPU endomorphism canonical form, cheap second point, XDP, GPU Bloom filter

### v56C
- Ultra-compact 16-byte DP entries (+56% capacity vs 25-byte format)
- Async BSGS resolver (4 threads, precomputed baby table)

### v53
- ALL-TAME mode, table freeze

### Earlier versions
- Dual hash table, uniform jumps, shard-locked reads
